title: "Trashwheel"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Load libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

## Import the dataset
I put this in excel to reformat the date column, because I got frustrated with R so it's stored locally.

```{r}
trashwheel <- readr::read_csv('c:/R/projects/tidytuesday/trashwheel.csv')
```

```{r}
head(trashwheel, 5)
```
```{r}
skim(trashwheel)
```

How many trashwheels are there?

```{r}
unique(trashwheel$Name)
unique(trashwheel$ID)
```

What data is missing?

```{r}
which(is.na(trashwheel$PlasticBottles))
which(is.na(trashwheel$Polystyrene))
which(is.na(trashwheel$CigaretteButts))
```

It looks like just that one row of data has null values, so I'll need to take that into account when working with the numbers.

Also, all trash types are not collected on all trashwheels. 


## Transform/wrangle

```{r}
timeframes <- trashwheel %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  summarize(
    MinDate = min(Year, na.rm = TRUE),
    MaxDate = max(Year, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

head(timeframes)
```

The trashwheels have been collecting for different amounts of time, with Mister being in operation for the longest time.

## Visualization

What type of trash is collected the most?

```{r}
options(scipen=999999999)
par(mar=c(5, 5, 3, 1))
barplot(colSums(trashwheel[,9:15], na.rm = TRUE),
        cex.names=0.7,
        main = "Types of trash collected",
        ylab = "",
        xlab = "Type of object",
        yaxt = "n",
        ylim = c(0, max(colSums(trashwheel[,9:15], na.rm = TRUE)) * 1.2))
y_range <- range(0, max(colSums(trashwheel[,9:15], na.rm = TRUE)) * 1.2)
axis(2, las = 2, at=seq(0, y_range[2], by=2500000), 
     labels=scales::comma(seq(0, y_range[2], by=2500000)), 
     cex.axis=0.7)
mtext("Count", side=2, line=4)
```

Questions not answered: Do the different Trash Wheels collect different sets of trash? 
Are there times of the year when more or less trash is collected?
