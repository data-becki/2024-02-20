# Rolling Stone Album Rankings

This week we're looking at album rankings from Rolling Stone. h/t Data is plural. A visual essay from The Pudding looks at what makes an album the greatest of all time, and shares the data they put together for the essay.

    A new visual essay from The Pudding compares Rolling Stone’s “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” lists from 2003, 2012, and 2020. A methodology note says the project began with a spreadsheet by Chris Eckert and eventually led the authors to develop a dataset of their own. Theirs lists every album in the rankings — its name, genre, release year, 2003/2012/2020 rank, the artist’s name, birth year, gender, and more — plus each year’s voters. [h/t Jason Kottke]
