# The Great American Coffee Taste Test

Data is from October 2023 from a survey of viewers on YouTube for the "Great American Coffee Taste Test" held by "world champion barista" James Hoffmann and coffee company Cometeer, where four types of their coffee were rated. Several questions were asked beyond just rating the coffee.

The data was cleaned to remove one-hot encoding (may be interesting for ML? Other models?), clean up the column names, and remove the flavorings column which was empty.

**This week's question: Do you think participants in this survey are representative of Americans in general?**
